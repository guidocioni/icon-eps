In the following repository I include a fully-functional suite of scripts 
needed to download, merge and plot data from the ICON-EU-EPS model,
which is freely available at https://opendata.dwd.de/weather/.

See documentation for ICON-EU (https://github.com/guidocioni/icon_forecasts) for an explanation all function. The behaviour is exactly the same.
